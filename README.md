🎵 Music Recommendation Engine

An end-to-end music recommendation system powered by machine learning (k-Nearest Neighbors) and served via a FastAPI backend.

This project takes a dataset of songs and their audio features (e.g., tempo, valence, danceability) and provides song recommendations based on similarity — with no user history or preferences required.

🧠 Features
- Audio-Based Similarity: Recommendations are based on features like energy, tempo, valence, etc.
- k-NN Model: Uses cosine distance in a scaled feature space to find similar tracks.
- FastAPI Backend:
- POST /recommendations: Get recommendations for one or more track IDs
- GET /songs: Browse the full list of songs with pagination
- No Database Required: Songs and model are loaded from CSV and NumPy files
- Similarity Scoring: Results are ranked by how close they are in sound profile

🚀 Endpoints

1. POST `/recommendations` - Returns recommended songs based on track ID(s).
```
{
  "track_ids": ["0xq4ZTcmwBfkPGo4RRKmMe", "61uyGDPJ06MkxJtHgPmuyO"],
  "top_n": 5
}
```
2. GET `/songs` - Fetches songs with pagination.
```
GET /songs?page=1&limit=10
```
